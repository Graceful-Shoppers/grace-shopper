    "Many serious gardeners spend a lot of time on their hands and knees in the garden. Not long ago we discovered that 1 of our long-time customers had carefully re-sized the shaft of our Pro-Lite Floral Shovel to turn it into a Mini Floral Shovel. That brought the blade close to the grip and made it possible to use the shovel very close to the ground. She was also using it in a series of raised beds for which a normal length shovel would have been awkward. I loved seeing the modified shovel being used in so many different ways: As a giant trowel as a small shovel and even as a support to help stand up from the kneeling gardening position. I figured if it was worth all of the effort to modify a shovel for this purpose then it was worth producing them for you. When a trowel is too small and a shovel is too big, it's time for the Mini-O. It's great for kids, too.",
