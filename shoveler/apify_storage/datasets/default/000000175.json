    "This Bigfoot pusher snow shovel feature's Emsco's patented double wide Shock Shield d-grip. The Shock Shield d-grip reduces and absorbs the shock that is normally transferred to user's wrists, elbows, and shoulders by compressing up to 1/2 in. after coming into contact with a sharp object or edge hidden under the snow. The Shock Shield can reduce unexpected impacts by up to 50%, which allows the user to shovel more efficiently without fear of discomfort or injury. This d-grip is 9.5 in. in wide, which allows the user to push with both hands to provide increased leverage and efficiency. In addition to the Shock Shield, the blade on this Emsco pusher shovel features an oversized radius, which allows the user to effortlessly roll snow off smooth surfaces - similar to a snow plow. Instead of having to stop shoveling due to snow piling up on the blade, you'll be able to effortlessly roll snow off of smooth surfaces in one motion. Work safer and smarter with the Bigfoot Double Wide Shock Shield Pusher from Emsco.",
