    "This Bigfoot combination snow shovel feature's Emsco's patented double wide Shock Shield d-grip. The Shock Shield d-grip reduces and absorbs the shock that is normally transferred to user's wrists, elbows, and shoulders by compressing up to 1/2 in. after coming into contact with a sharp object or edge hidden under the snow. The Shock Shield can reduce unexpected impacts by up to 50%, which allows the user to shovel more efficiently without fear of discomfort or injury. This d-grip is 9.5 in. in wide, which allows the user to push with both hands to provide increased leverage and efficiency. In addition to the Shock Shield, the blade on this Emsco combination shovel combines a standard snow shovel, snow scoop, and snow pusher design to create one super snow shovel. The blade has the ease of use of a standard shovel, the holding capacity of a scoop shovel, and the curve of a pusher shovel to clear flat surfaces. Work safer and smarter with the Bigfoot Shock Shield Combination Shovel from Emsco.",
