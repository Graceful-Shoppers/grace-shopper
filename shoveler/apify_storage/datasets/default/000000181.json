    "Bully Tools 12-Gauge fiberglass shovels utilize a triple wall fiberglass, wood reinforced handle design and an extra thick 12-Gauge steel blade. Great for homeowners and contractors, it is just as strong and hefty as a wood shovel, with the added comfort of a fiberglass handle. All Bully Tools shovels have a closed back design that prevents debris getting stuck while digging. The extended ferrule and welded I-beam support increases strength while prying. In testing, the steel shovel head bends before the handle breaks in both wood and fiberglass models. The Dgrips have been redesigned for superior comfort and durability. Made with a special no-break Polypropylene co-polymer, you won't find a stronger dgrip. Watch our video to see it crush a cement block.",
