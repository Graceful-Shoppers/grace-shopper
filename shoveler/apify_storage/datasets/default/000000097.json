    "The Bigfoot Combination Snow Shovel in Arctic Camouflague is manufactured by using a patented process that utilizes multiple colors to create an arctic camoflague color pattern. This shovel is truly unique and seemlessly blends into winter landscapes. It's a great conversation piece to have around your house or camp. In addition to an arctic camouflage design, the blade on this Emsco combination shovel combines a standard snow shovel, snow scoop and snow pusher hybrid design to create one super snow shovel. The blade has the ease of use of a standard shovel, the holding capacity of a scoop shovel and the curve of a pusher shovel to clear flat surfaces.",
