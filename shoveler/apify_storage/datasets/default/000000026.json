    "Our Snow Scoop Shovel features an angled handle that keeps your wrist in a neutral position to reduce strain, and an angled, large head that makes it easy to move large amounts of snow with each scoop. A patented steel blade at the end of the scoop digs into hard-packed snow, and the D-handle and shaft feature non-slip grips to improve control, reduce hand fatigue and insulate against cold. The aluminum shaft provides excellent durability while reducing weight for easy use, the reinforced polypropylene head is lightweight yet stiff, and the D-handle design offers space-saving hanging storage.",
