    "Rely on the strength of the True Temper 36 in. Industrial Grade Snow Pusher to help you remove snow and slush quickly throughout the winter season. The plow shape of the blade helps you push away snow and slush from wide areas and is made from UHMW Nylon, a material that is long-lasting and wear resistant to withstand the demands of heavy snow removal. It is also safe on all outdoor surfaces which enables you to clear your driveway, sidewalk, deck and patio surfaces with 1-tool. As you remove snow, gain more leverage with the Versa Grip, an ergonomically designed grip that accommodates multiple hand positions for pushing, scooping and unloading piles of snow. In addition to the Versa Grip, your hands are also secured with the anti-slip grip provided by the TPE resin-covered steel handle.",
