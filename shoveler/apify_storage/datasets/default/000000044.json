Handle balanced and weighted for comfort. Dimensions: 15.7 in. (40 cm) length, 2.7 in. (6.9 cm) blade width. Unibody silicone construction, heat resistant to 550°F, Easy-to-clean, dishwasher and nonstick safe, and nearly indestructible - it will not discolor, warp, melt, or chip. This solid silicone spatula won't scratch or damage delicate cookware. Our proprietary fiberglass core provides better heat resistance and longer life than cheap iron and stainless steel cores, which heat up the handle and degrade silicone quality. The unibody design is super hygienic - no holes or seams for food/oils to get caught in, so no place for bacteria to grow. Dishwasher safe on any rack or extremely Easy-to-clean by hand. Made to last forever in your kitchen and comes with a manufacturer's 100% Lifetime Satisfaction Guarantee, no questions asked. FDA + LFGB approved, BPA, BPS, and phthalate free.
