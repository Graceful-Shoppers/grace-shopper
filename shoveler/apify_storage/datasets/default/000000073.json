  "description":
    "Great for tight spots and making neat metal detecting plugs. Easy to carry on expeditions. The 32 in. Mini-Root Assassin is designed for treasure hunting and metal detecting as well as smaller gardening jobs. Weighing 2.2 lbs. it's light enough to be taken along for a long day and yet strong and dense enough to provide the leverage needed to get the job done. It is an excellent addition to your garden tools and metal detecting equipment. Metal detector hobbyists love the mini because the patented \"teeth\" can cut deeply and cleanly in small areas so as not to disturb the landscape yet effective enough to get the job done. The Mini-Root Assassin is excellent for clearing-out an overgrown area of garden, forest or brush in tight places. The engineered \"bone structure\" adds amazing strength and the curved sharpened tip cuts roots easily. The unique shape of the serrated teeth located on both sides of the shovel is built to withstand the toughest jobs and can be sharpened with a wheel or grinder. The secret of the shovel is the fact that the teeth cut roots when pushing in and when pulling out. The shovel is made of industrial grade steel and is overlaid with a sleek silver color powder coat. The ergonomically designed steel shaft is topped by with durable solid plastic /rubber coated bright red handle for comfort and ease of locating amid the grounds.",
