    "Patented wings cuts work time and effort The unique shovel with Wings was designed for carrying larger pay loads without spillage off the sides. Ideal for trenching and cutting sod in 1-shot (hence the name) with the added benefits of a cleaner and neater shoveling job. The Wings also significantly increase the strength of the shovel blade and provide extra foot support for those tough digging jobs. The extra weight added by the wings is offset by the lighter and stronger fiberglass handle for superior strength of the transition from handle to blade. The shovel has many practical uses and can perform as a round point shovel with extra capabilities. Huge load capacity. Ergonomic design. Huge foot step for easy use. Lifetime replacement warranty 43 in. long and Weighs just 6 lbs. Steel Blade with Fiberglass Handle.",
