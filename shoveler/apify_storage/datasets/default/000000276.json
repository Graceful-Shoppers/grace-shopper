    "The Round Point shovel is the most popular type of shovel in North America. The Root Slayer Round Head Shovel is a heavy duty, root cutting version of that shovel with an inverted V cutting tip instead of a round point. As with all Root Slayer products, you should consider buying this shovel when you have dense clay soil, rocks and shale in your soil, roots and other dense organic material. This shovel, with its very ample surface area, will move a lot of dirt without getting hung up on minor obstructions. You'll be amazed at how quickly and easily you can move and divide perennials and shrubs with this monster shovel.",
