  "description":
    "An astute customer of ours pointed out that the original Root Slayer Shovel can be overkill for many gardening tasks and even too heavy for some older gardeners. She said we should design a lightweight version specifically for working with perennials. So we started with a blade that is about 70% of the size of the Root Slayer Shovel, added a lightweight super durable fiberglass shaft and topped it off with our patented O-handle grip. The Root Slayer Perennial Shovel is truly a miracle worker in the garden. We recently dug out, divided and transplanted a sizable bed of daylilies in about half the normal time with this incredible tool. The sharpened inverted V cutting tip prevents perennial roots from slipping from underneath the shovel blade while dividing. And, it's every bit as useful for raised beds, flower gardens and general digging.",
