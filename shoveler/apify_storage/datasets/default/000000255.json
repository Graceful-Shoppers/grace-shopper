    "Nupla has been an innovator for over 70 years in the development of fiberglass technologies and has earned the reputation as the industry standard for fiberglass striking, cutting, digging, and fire tools. Nupla handles are unaffected by subzero temperatures, do not conduct heat or cold and are impervious to industrial chemicals. The 27 in. Round Point Shovel handle is solid pultruded fiberglass made with thousands of fiberglass strands and a unique resin making it super strong and resistant to weather, chemicals and insects (unlike most wooden handles). The solid Nuplaglas handle is manufactured in Safety Orange for easy identification and provides electrical insulation on the job. This tool is specifically designed to replace wood or steel digging tools in high voltage areas.",
