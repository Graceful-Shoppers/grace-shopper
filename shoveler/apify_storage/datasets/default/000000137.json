    "Bully Tools Shingle Shovels feature a design preferred by professionals. True 14-Gauge steel with a back fulcrum tears through roofing shingles with the perfect power and leverage. The triple wall fiberglass handle resists breakage while still being lightweight and easy to handle. The Dgrips have been redesigned for superior comfort and durability. Made with a special no-break Polypropylene co-polymer, you won't find a stronger dgrip. Watch our video to see it crush a cement block.",
