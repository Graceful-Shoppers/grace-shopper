  "description":
    "We had never even heard of a CapRock Shovel when we released the original Root Slayer Shovel, but 1 of our customers thought the inverted V cutting tip and ripsaw teeth along the edges of our Root Slayer would be just as useful on a CapRock Shovel. So, we purchased the top 3 competitive products we could find, tested them all for functionality and strength, then built the Root Slayer CapRock Shovel extra-large for extra performance and strength while cutting out nearly half of the weight of the other products. The most extreme application for the CapRock Shovel is just what it sounds like: shoveling rocks. We couldn't be more pleased with the way the twin points at the sides of the inverted V find the easiest path through the toughest obstructions. This is a heavy duty shovel you can use for life.",
