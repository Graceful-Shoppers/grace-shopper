    "The Bigfoot Lightweight Pusher Snow Shovel features an enormous 25 in. wide blade specially designed to clear snow off flat surfaces, such as walkways and decks. The extreme radius of the blade allows for the shovel to effortlessly roll snow like a snow plow. Competitive pusher shovels allow snow to build up on the blade when clearing snow, which causes the user to work harder and less efficiently. This Bigfoot Snow Pusher is made from lightweight, extremely durable resin that allows for easy usage while moving massive amounts of snow. The shovel's handle is constructed from lightweight aluminum and features a deluxe, extra-large D-grip with a cushion padded grip.",
