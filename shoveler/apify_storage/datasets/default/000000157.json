    "When winter strikes, reach for the snow attachment made specifically for your SwitchStik. Now there's a SwitchStik solution for every season with the addition of the 18 snow shovel attachment. Connect with a flick of the switch to clear away snow and slush from steps, walkways or the deck. The durable, non-stick poly blade quickly sheds snow and ice to clear to the ground without damaging your deck or pavement. Also great in the yard and garden for transporting mulch and soil. Add 4 season functionality to your SwitchStik system, and switch up your snow-clearing routine this winter.",
