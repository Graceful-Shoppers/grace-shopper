    "The Bigfoot Combination Shovel with Adjustable Ergonomic Handle is one of the most unique ergonomic snow shovel's available. The power lift handle adjusts to the height of any user by utilizing a screw collar that can be adjusted to the user's arm length and position. This feature allows the user to shovel snow with very little bending over and lessens stress on your lower back. After lifting the snow, the user can simply twist their wrist, which causes the blade to turn and snow to be released. The blade on this emsco combination shovel combines a standard snow shovel, snow scoop and snow pusher hybrid design to create one super snow shovel. The blade has the ease of use of a standard shovel, the holding capacity of a scoop shovel and the curve of a pusher shovel to clear flat surfaces.",
