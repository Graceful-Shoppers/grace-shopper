  "description":
    "North American gardeners and landscapers love round-point shovels. This 1 has a larger blade than most, as well as a slightly cupped shape. Old-timers might recognize this as close to what was once called a Sand Shovel. Nowadays that term is pretty much reserved for children's toys, but we can assure you that this is no toy. The shape of the blade is indeed quite useful when working in sand and sandy soils. The real beauty of this shovel is that it works well in all conditions, can be used all day long by professionals and won't break like most cheap transfer shovels today. Radius Pro-Lite tools are 4 in. to 5 in. longer than their PRO counterparts and feature the same large O handle and extra-wide raised forward kick for reduced strain, better balance and ease-of-use.",
