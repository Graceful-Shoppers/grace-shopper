    "Stay prepared on the road by keeping this all-purpose shovel in your vehicle. The telescoping handle can be adjusted up to a 32 in. L so you can work comfortably, while the polypropylene grip ensures you have a good hold. This shovel is constructed of lightweight and durable powder-coated anodized aluminum that makes it easy to transport, yet tough enough to handle snow, sand, soil and more. To store the shovel, just take it apart and stow the 3 separate pieces in the included carrying case which features a drawstring enclosure. Not only is this portable shovel great to keep in your vehicle, but you can also keep it in your backpack for camping and hiking or in your garden caddy for backyard projects.",
