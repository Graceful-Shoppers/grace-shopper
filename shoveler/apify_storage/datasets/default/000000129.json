    "When it’s time to stir the soup or if you’re fishing dumplings, meatballs or tortellini out of a sauce or boiling water, you need a slotted spoon that’s always within arm’s reach, that’s why this lazy slotted spoon is a must-have. The spoon has a side notch so it can easily perch on the pot, waiting for the next time you need it. Not only does the spoon remain conveniently at hand, but any drips land safely back in the pot, not on the counter or stovetop. Rachael Ray Tools and Gadgets all have one thing in mind: making time in the kitchen fun and efficient. This Lazy Slotted Spoon certainly fills both criteria with its bright color and innovative design. It is crafted from tough yet contoured silicone for extra comfort in the kitchen and features a side notch so it can rest on the edges of cookware, always within easy reach. The slotted spoon also saves the counter from being studded with drips and splashes. Conveniently, the Lazy Slotted Spoon is heat resistant to 500°F and dishwasher safe for simple cleanup.Slotted Spoon with side notchLazy Slotted Spoon features a side notch so it can rest on the side of pots and pans when not in use, keeping drips off countertopsLazy Slotted Spoon is dishwasher safe for easy cleanupDurable, contoured silicone is conveniently heat resistant to 500 degrees FahrenheitRachael Ray is a trademark of Ray Marks Co.
