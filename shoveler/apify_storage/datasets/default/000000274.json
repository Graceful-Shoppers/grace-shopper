    "The 34 in. Bigfoot Kid Safe Poly Snow Shovel is the perfect shovel for your child to help you clear snow off driveways, yards or decks. While shovelling snow might seem like a chore, shovelling snow alongside your child can be a fun bonding experience. The Bigfoot kid's shovel is constructed as one molded piece and includes reinforced ribbing throughout the shovel's blade, handle and d-grip to create an extremely durable, light weight and kid safe (non-metal) shovel. The shovel is also bright orange so that it can be easily seen in the snow if misplaced.",
