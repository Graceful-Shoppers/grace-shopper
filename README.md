# Graceful Shoveler

Graceful Shoveler is a fully functional e-commerce website selling all varieties of shovels and is deployed at https://graceful-shoveler.herokuapp.com/ It was developed by Edgar Camacho, Tom Sinovich, Jacob Gee, and Ben Jenkins as our "Grace Shopper" project at Fullstack Academy. Graceful Shoveler was designed with a mobile first mindset using React, Redux, Sequelize, and Express. Infinite scrolling was implented to comply with our mobile first approach. All styling for this project was done using Styled Components to write CSS in Javascript.
